# Priority-Queue-using-heap
⏭️ A simple implementation of a Priority Queue using heap in Python

### Implementation

A class PriorityQueue is implemented, as well as its methods:
- push()
- pop()
- isEmpty()
- update()

A function PQSort(list) sorts a list of integers, using the Priority Queue.


### Testing

Tests are implemented from [Giannis Zapantis](https://github.com/tech-gian).

They are checking all of the PriorityQueue functions and are listed in the
corresponding file.
